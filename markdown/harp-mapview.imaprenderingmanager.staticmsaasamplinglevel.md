## IMapRenderingManager.staticMsaaSamplingLevel property

The higher level of MSAA sampling for a last frame to render, when the camera is static. It can be a high level, providing high quality renders requiring few tens of seconds, since no frame is expected to immediately follow in the requestAnimationFrame. It is still limited by zooming, since zooming is not requestAnimationFrame-based and can lead to stuttering if the render time is too long, except on desktop Mac, where mouse interaction already implements some damping. Higher levels of sampling may lead to noticeable color banding, visible in areas with a slight color gradient, like large areas or the sky background.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
staticMsaaSamplingLevel: MSAASampling;
```
