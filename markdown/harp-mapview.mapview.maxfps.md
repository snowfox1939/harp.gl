## MapView.maxFps property

Maximum FPS (Frames Per Second). If VSync in enabled, the specified number may not be reached, but instead the next smaller number than `maxFps` that is equal to the refresh rate divided by an integer number.

E.g.: If the monitors refresh rate is set to 60hz, and if `maxFps` is set to a value of `40` (60hz/1.5), the actual used FPS may be 30 (60hz/2). For displays that have a refresh rate of 60hz, good values for `maxFps` are 30, 20, 15, 12, 10, 6, 3 and 1. A value of `0` is ignored.
