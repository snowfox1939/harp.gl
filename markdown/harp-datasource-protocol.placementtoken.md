## PlacementToken enum

Defines options (tokens) supported for text placements defined via \[\[placements\]\] attribute.

Possible values are defined as vertical placement letter and horizontal letter, where one of the axis may be ignored and then assumed centered. Moving clock-wise, we have: `TL` (top-left), `T` (top-center), `TR` (top-right), `R` (center-right), `BR` (bottom-right), `B` (bottom-center), `BL` (bottom-left), `L` (left), `C` (center-center). Alternatively instead of `T`<!-- -->, `B`<!-- -->, `L`<!-- -->, `R` geographic directions may be used accordingly: `NW` (north-west), `N` (north), `NE` (north-east), `E` (east), `SE` (south-east), `S` (south), `SW` (south-west), `W` (west).

export declare enum PlacementToken
