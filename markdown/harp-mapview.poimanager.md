|  [getImageTexture(name)](./harp-mapview.poimanager.getimagetexture.md) |  | Return the \[\[ImageTexture\]\] registered under the specified name. |
|  [updatePoiFromPoiTable(pointLabel)](./harp-mapview.poimanager.updatepoifrompoitable.md) |  | Update the \[\[TextElement\]\] with the information taken from the \[\[PoiTable\]\] which is referenced in the \[\[PoiInfo\]\] of the pointLabel.<!-- -->If the requested \[\[PoiTable\]\] is not available yet, the function returns <code>false</code>. If the \[\[PoiTable\]\] is not defined, or if the references POI has no entry in the \[\[PoiTable\]\], no action is taken, and the function returns <code>false</code>.<!-- -->If the \[\[PoiTable\]\] has been processed, it returns <code>true</code>, indicating that this function doesn't have to be called again. |
