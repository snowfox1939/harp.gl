## MapViewPoints class

`MapViewPoints` is a class to extend for the `"circles"` and `"squares"` \[\[Technique\]\]s to implement raycasting of \[\[THREE.Points\]\] as expected in \[\[MapView\]\], that are in screen space. It copies the behaviour of the `raycast` method in \[\[THREE.Points\]\] and dispatches it to its children classes, \[\[Circles\]\] and \[\[Squares\]\], who hold the intersection testing in the `testPoint` method. This class also has the ability to dismiss the testing via the `enableRayTesting` flag.

Its main motivation is to handle the point styles of XYZ projects.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare abstract class MapViewPoints extends THREE.Points 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [enableRayTesting](./harp-mapview.mapviewpoints.enableraytesting.md) |  | boolean | This allows to discard the ray testing. |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [raycast(raycaster, intersects)](./harp-mapview.mapviewpoints.raycast.md) |  | This method is similar to the original method <code>raycast</code> in \[\[THREE.Points\]\] except that it then calls the tailored <code>testPoint</code> method in the children classes to test intersections depending on whether the points are circles or squares, which \[\[THREE.Points\]\] cannot do. |
|  [testPoint(point, screenPosition, pickCoordinates, index, distance, intersects)](./harp-mapview.mapviewpoints.testpoint.md) |  | Implements the intersection testing in screen space between the drawn points and the ray. The drawing of the points being different between \[\[Circles\]\] and \[\[Squares\]\], this method is implemented in these child classes. |
