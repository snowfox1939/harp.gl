## MapControls class

This map control provides basic map-related building blocks to interact with the map. It also provides a default way of handling user input. Currently we support basic mouse interaction and touch input interaction.

Mouse interaction: - Left mouse button + move = Panning the map. - Right mouse button + move = Orbits the camera around the focus point. - Middle mouse button + move = Rotating the view. Up down movement changes the pitch. Left/right movement changes the yaw. - Mouse wheel = Zooms up and down by one zoom level, zooms on target.

Touch interaction: - One finger = Panning the map. - Two fingers = Scale, rotate and panning the map. - Three fingers = Orbiting the map. Up down movements influences the current orbit altitude. Left/right changes the azimuth.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class MapControls extends THREE.EventDispatcher 
```

|  [(constructor)(mapView)](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols._constructor_.md) |  | Constructs a new <code>MapControls</code> object. |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [attitude](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.attitude.md) |  | [MapViewUtils.Attitude](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.attitude.md) | Current viewing angles yaw/pitch/roll in degrees. |
|  [camera](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.camera.md) |  | THREE.Camera | Three.js camera that this controller affects. |
|  [cameraHeight](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.cameraheight.md) |  | number | Get the current camera height. |
|  [dispose](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.dispose.md) |  | () =&gt; void | Destroy this <code>MapControls</code> instance.<!-- -->Unregisters all global event handlers used. This is method should be called when you stop using <code>MapControls</code>. |
|  [domElement](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.domelement.md) |  | HTMLCanvasElement | Map's HTML DOM element. |
|  [doubleTapTime](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.doubletaptime.md) |  | number | Double click uses the OS delay through the double click event. Tapping is implemented locally here in <code>MapControls</code> with this duration setting the maximum delay to define a double tap. The value is in seconds. <code>300ms</code> is picked as the default value as jQuery does. |
|  [enabled](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.enabled.md) |  | boolean | Set to <code>true</code> to enable input handling through this map control, <code>false</code> to disable input handling. Even when disabling input handling, you can manually use the public functions to change the view to the current map. |
|  [inertiaEnabled](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.inertiaenabled.md) |  | boolean | Set to <code>true</code> to enable an inertia dampening on zooming and panning. <code>false</code> cancels inertia. |
|  [mapView](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.mapview.md) |  | [MapView](./harp-mapview.mapview.md) |  |
|  [maxTiltAngle](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.maxtiltangle.md) |  | number | Get the camera max tilt angle in degrees. |
|  [maxZoomLevel](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.maxzoomlevel.md) |  | number | Determines the maximum zoom level we can zoom to. |
|  [minCameraHeight](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.mincameraheight.md) |  | number | Determines the minimum camera height in meter. |
|  [minZoomLevel](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.minzoomlevel.md) |  | number | Determines the minimum zoom level we can zoom to. |
|  [northResetAnimationDuration](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.northresetanimationduration.md) |  | number | Duration of the animation to reset the camera to looking north, in seconds. Independent of inertia. |
|  [orbitingMouseDeltaFactor](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.orbitingmousedeltafactor.md) |  | number | This factor will be applied to the delta of the current mouse pointer position and the last mouse pointer position: The result then will be used as an offset to orbit the camera. Default value is <code>0.1</code>. |
|  [orbitingTouchDeltaFactor](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.orbitingtouchdeltafactor.md) |  | number | This factor will be applied to the delta of the current touch pointer position and the last touch pointer position: The result then will be used as an offset to orbit the camera. Default value is <code>0.1</code>. |
|  [panInertiaDampingDuration](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.paninertiadampingduration.md) |  | number | Inertia damping duration for the panning, in seconds. |
|  [rotateEnabled](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.rotateenabled.md) |  | boolean | Set to <code>true</code> to enable rotation through this map control, <code>false</code> to disable rotation. |
|  [rotationMouseDeltaFactor](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.rotationmousedeltafactor.md) |  | number | This factor will be applied to the delta of the current mouse pointer position and the last mouse pointer position: The result then will be used as an offset for the rotation then. Default value is <code>0.1</code>. |
|  [tiltAngle](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.tiltangle.md) |  | number | Camera tilt to the target when tilting from the <code>toggleTilt</code> public method. |
|  [tiltEnabled](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.tiltenabled.md) |  | boolean | Set to <code>true</code> to enable orbiting and tilting through these controls, <code>false</code> otherwise. |
|  [tiltState](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.tiltstate.md) |  | [TiltState](./harp-map-controls.tiltstate.md) | Handy getter to know if the view is in the process of looking down or not. |
|  [tiltToggleDuration](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.tilttoggleduration.md) |  | number | Duration in seconds of the camera animation when the tilt button is clicked. Independent of inertia. |
|  [zoomInertiaDampingDuration](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.zoominertiadampingduration.md) |  | number | Inertia damping duration for the zoom, in seconds. |
|  [zoomLevelDeltaOnControl](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.zoomleveldeltaoncontrol.md) |  | number | Zoom level delta when using the UI controls. |
|  [zoomLevelDeltaOnDoubleClick](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.zoomleveldeltaondoubleclick.md) |  | number | Zoom level delta to apply when double clicking or double tapping. <code>0</code> disables the feature. |
|  [zoomLevelDeltaOnMouseWheel](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.zoomleveldeltaonmousewheel.md) |  | number | Determines the zoom level delta for single mouse wheel movement. So after each mouse wheel movement the current zoom level will be added or subtracted by this value. The default value is <code>0.2</code> - this means that every 5th mouse wheel movement you will cross a zoom level.<!-- -->\*\*Note\*\*: To reverse the zoom direction, you can provide a negative value. |
|  [zoomLevelTargeted](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.zoomleveltargeted.md) |  | number | Get the zoom level targeted by <code>MapControls</code>. Useful when inertia is on, to add incremented values to the target instead of getting the random zoomLevel value during the interpolation. |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [create(mapView)](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.create.md) | <code>static</code> | Creates MapControls object and attaches it specified \[\[MapView\]\]. |
|  [moveAlongTheViewDirection(amount)](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.movealongtheviewdirection.md) |  | Moves the camera along the view direction in meters. A positive value will move the camera further away from the point where the camera looks at. A negative value will move the camera near to the point where the camera looks at. |
|  [pointToNorth()](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.pointtonorth.md) |  | Reset the camera to looking north, in an orbiting movement around the target point instead of changing the yaw (which would be the camera rotating on itself). |
|  [setZoomLevel(zoomLevel, screenTarget)](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.setzoomlevel.md) |  | Zooms to the desired location by the provided value. |
|  [toggleTilt()](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.toggletilt.md) |  | Toggles the camera tilt between 0 (looking down) and the value at <code>this.tiltAngle</code>. |
|  [zoomOnTargetPosition(targetPositionOnScreenXinNDC, targetPositionOnScreenYinNDC, zoomLevel)](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.zoomontargetposition.md) |  | Zooms and moves the map in such a way that the given target position remains at the same position after the zoom. |
