## DataSource.storageLevelOffset property

The difference between storage level and display level of tile.

Storage level offset is a value applied (added) to current zoom level giving a final tile level being displayed. This way we may differentate current zoom level from the storage level that is displayed, giving fine grained control over the tiles being decoded an displayed.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
get storageLevelOffset(): number;

set storageLevelOffset(levelOffset: number);
```
