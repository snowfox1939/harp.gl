## TileOffsetUtils.getKeyForTileKeyAndOffset() function

Creates a unique key based on the supplied parameters. Note, the uniqueness is bounded by the bitshift. The \[\[TileKey.mortonCode()\]\] supports currently up to 26 levels (this is because 26\*2 equals 52, and 2^52 is the highest bit that can be set in an integer in Javascript), the bitshift reduces this accordingly, so given the default bitshift of four, we support up to 24 levels. Given the current support up to level 19 this should be fine.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
function getKeyForTileKeyAndOffset(tileKey: TileKey, offset: number, bitshift?: number): number;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  tileKey | [TileKey](./harp-geoutils.tilekey.md) | The unique \[\[TileKey\]\] from which to compute the unique key. |
|  offset | number | How much the given \[\[TileKey\]\] is offset |
|  bitshift | number | How much space we have to store the offset. The default of 4 means we have enough space to store 16 unique tiles in a single view. |

<b>Returns:</b>

number
