## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [calculateDepthFromClipDistance(clipDistance, camera)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.calculatedepthfromclipdistance.md) | Translates a linear clip-space distance value to the actual value stored in the depth buffer. This is useful as the depth values are not stored in the depth buffer linearly, and this can lead into confusing behavior when not taken into account. |
|  [calculateDistanceFromZoomLevel(options, zoomLevel)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.calculatedistancefromzoomlevel.md) | Calculates and returns the distance to the target point. |
|  [calculateDistanceToGroundFromZoomLevel(options, zoomLevel)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.calculatedistancetogroundfromzoomlevel.md) | Calculates and returns the distance from the ground, which is needed to put the camera to this height, to see the size of the area that would be covered by one tile for the given zoom level. |
|  [calculateFocalLengthByVerticalFov(vFov, height)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.calculatefocallengthbyverticalfov.md) | Calculates the focal length based on the vertical FOV and height. |
|  [calculateFovByFocalLength(focalLength, height)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.calculatefovbyfocallength.md) | Calculates the vertical field of view based on the focal length and the height. |
|  [calculateHorizontalFovByVerticalFov(vFov, aspect)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.calculatehorizontalfovbyverticalfov.md) | Calculates horizontal field of view for given vertical field of vision and aspect ratio. |
|  [calculateScreenSizeByFocalLength(focalLength, distance, worldSize)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.calculatescreensizebyfocallength.md) | Calculates object's screen size based on the focal length and it's camera distance. |
|  [calculateVerticalFovByHorizontalFov(hFov, aspect)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.calculateverticalfovbyhorizontalfov.md) | Calculates vertical field of view for given horizontal field of vision and aspect ratio. |
|  [calculateWorldSizeByFocalLength(focalLength, distance, screenSize)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.calculateworldsizebyfocallength.md) | Calculates object's world size based on the focal length and it's camera distance. |
|  [calculateZoomLevelFromDistance(options, distance)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.calculatezoomlevelfromdistance.md) | Calculates the zoom level, which corresponds to the current distance from camera to lookAt point. Therefore the zoom level is a <code>float</code> and not an <code>int</code>. The height of the camera can be in between zoom levels. By setting the zoom level, you change the height position of the camera in away that the field of view of the camera should be able to cover one tile for the given zoom level.<!-- -->As an example for this, when you have a tile of zoom level 14 in front of the camera and you set the zoom level of the camera to 14, then you are able to see the whole tile in front of you. |
|  [cameraToWorldDistance(distance, camera)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.cameratoworlddistance.md) | Translates a linear distance value \[0..1\], where 1 is the distance to the far plane, into \[0..cameraFar\]. |
|  [estimateObject3dSize(object, parentSize, visitedObjects)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.estimateobject3dsize.md) | Computes estimate for size of a THREE.Object3D object and its children. Shared materials and/or attributes will be counted multiple times. |
|  [extractAttitude(options, object)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.extractattitude.md) | Extracts yaw, pitch, and roll rotation in radians. - Yaw : Rotation around the vertical axis, counter-clockwise (as opposed to azimuth), starting north. - Pitch :Rotation around the horizontal axis. - Roll : Rotation around the view axis. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion\_between\_quaternions\_and\_Euler\_angles |
|  [extractCameraTilt(camera, projection)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.extractcameratilt.md) | Extracts current camera tilt angle in radians. |
|  [extractSphericalCoordinatesFromLocation(mapView, object, location)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.extractsphericalcoordinatesfromlocation.md) | Gets the spherical coordinates in radian of the object to the coordinates of <code>point</code>.<!-- -->Note: this method can be used to get the direction that an object points to, when <code>location</code> is the target of that object, by adding PI to it. Otherwise it only returns the spherical coordinates of <code>object</code> in the tangent space of <code>location</code>. |
|  [extractTiltAngleFromLocation(projection, object, location)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.extracttiltanglefromlocation.md) | Gets the tilt angle (in radians) of the object relative to the coordinates of <code>location</code>.<!-- -->Note: this method can be used to get the direction that an object points to, when <code>location</code> is the target of that object, by adding PI to it. Otherwise it only returns the tilt angle (in radians) of <code>object</code> in the tangent space of <code>location</code>. |
|  [getBrowserLanguages()](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.getbrowserlanguages.md) | Gets language list used by the browser |
|  [getCameraCoordinatesFromTargetCoordinates(targetCoordinates, distance, yawDeg, pitchDeg, mapView)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.getcameracoordinatesfromtargetcoordinates.md) |  |
|  [getCameraFrustumPlanes(camera)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.getcamerafrustumplanes.md) | Get perspective camera frustum planes distances.  all plane distances in helper object. |
|  [getCameraPositionFromTargetCoordinates(targetCoordinates, distance, yawDeg, pitchDeg, projection, result)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.getcamerapositionfromtargetcoordinates.md) | Returns the \[\[GeoCoordinates\]\] of the camera, given its target coordinates on the map and its zoom, yaw and pitch. |
|  [getCameraRotationAtTarget(projection, target, yawDeg, pitchDeg, result)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.getcamerarotationattarget.md) | Computes the rotation of the camera according to yaw and pitch in degrees. The computations hinge on the current <code>projection</code> and <code>target</code>, because yaw and pitch are defined in tangent space of the target point.<!-- -->\*\*Note:\*\* <code>yaw == 0 &amp;&amp; pitch == 0</code> will north up the map and you will look downwards onto the map. |
|  [getGeoTargetFromCamera(camera, projection, elevation)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.getgeotargetfromcamera.md) | Calculate target (focus) point geo-coordinates for given camera.  getTargetPositionFromCamera |
|  [getWorldTargetFromCamera(camera, projection, elevation)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.getworldtargetfromcamera.md) | Calculate target (focus) point world coordinates for given camera position and orientation. |

The return value can be <code>null</code> when the raycast is above the horizon. |
|  [rayCastWorldCoordinates(mapView, pointOnScreenXinNDC, pointOnScreenYinNDC, elevation)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.raycastworldcoordinates.md) | Casts a ray in NDC space from the current map view and returns the intersection point of that ray wih the map in world space. |
|  [rotate(mapView, deltaYawDeg, deltaPitchDeg, maxTiltAngleRad)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.rotate.md) | Rotates the camera by the given delta yaw and delta pitch. The pitch will be clamped to the maximum possible tilt to the new target, and under the horizon in sphere projection. |
|  [setRotation(mapView, yawDeg, pitchDeg)](./harp-mapview.mapviewutils.setrotation.md) | Sets the rotation of the camera according to yaw and pitch in degrees. The computations hinge on the current projection and <code>geoCenter</code>, because yaw and pitch are defined in tangent space. In particular, <code>MapView#geoCenter</code> needs to be set before calling <code>setRotation</code>.<!-- -->\*\*Note:\*\* <code>yaw == 0 &amp;&amp; pitch == 0</code> will north up the map and you will look downwards onto the map. |
