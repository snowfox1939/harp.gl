## CirclePointsMaterial class

Material designed to render circle points. Note that it is always transparent since the circle shape is created with an alpha channel to benefit an antialising that a mere `discard` could not bring.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class CirclePointsMaterial extends THREE.ShaderMaterial 
```
