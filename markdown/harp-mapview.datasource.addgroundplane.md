## DataSource.addGroundPlane property

Whether the datasource should have a ground plane (this plane covers the tile entirely and has the minimum possible renderOrder), this can be required in some cases when fallback parent tiles need to be covered by the children, otherwise the content will overlap. Default is false

addGroundPlane: boolean;
```
