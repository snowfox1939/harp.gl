## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [CameraAnimation](./harp-map-controls.cameraanimation.md) | Abstract class used as base to define camera animations. |
|  [CameraPanAnimation](./harp-map-controls.camerapananimation.md) | Class to pan between the specified geo coordinates. Height can be specified to move the camera in and out. |
|  [CameraRotationAnimation](./harp-map-controls.camerarotationanimation.md) | Create an animation around the Z-axis of the camera. |
|  [LongPressHandler](./harp-map-controls.longpresshandler.md) | Class that can be used to track long presses on an HTML Element. A long press is a press that lasts a minimum duration (see the \[\[timeout\]\] member) while the mouse is not moved more than a certain threshold (see the \[\[moveThreshold\]\] member). |
|  [MapControls](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrols.md) | This map control provides basic map-related building blocks to interact with the map. It also provides a default way of handling user input. Currently we support basic mouse interaction and touch input interaction.<!-- -->Mouse interaction: - Left mouse button + move = Panning the map. - Right mouse button + move = Orbits the camera around the focus point. - Middle mouse button + move = Rotating the view. Up down movement changes the pitch. Left/right movement changes the yaw. - Mouse wheel = Zooms up and down by one zoom level, zooms on target.<!-- -->Touch interaction: - One finger = Panning the map. - Two fingers = Scale, rotate and panning the map. - Three fingers = Orbiting the map. Up down movements influences the current orbit altitude. Left/right changes the azimuth. |
|  [MapControlsUI](./harp-map-controls.mapcontrolsui.md) | Base class to handle UI overlay elements. |

## Enumerations

|  Enumeration | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [EasingFunction](./harp-map-controls.easingfunction.md) | Functions used for specifying animations' speed. |
|  [EventNames](./harp-map-controls.eventnames.md) | Map interaction events' names. |
|  [InterpolationFunction](./harp-map-controls.interpolationfunction.md) | Functions used to generate intermediate animation values. |
|  [TiltState](./harp-map-controls.tiltstate.md) |  |

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [azimuthAltitudeToDirection(azimuth, altitude)](./harp-map-controls.azimuthaltitudetodirection.md) | Returns the direction vector that is described by the given azimuth and altitude. |
|  [calculateNormalizedDeviceCoordinates(screenCoordinateX, screenCoordinateY, screenSizeX, screenSizeY)](./harp-map-controls.calculatenormalizeddevicecoordinates.md) | Transforms the given point in screen space into NDC space by taking the given screen dimension into account. |
|  [getWidthAndHeightFromCanvas(canvas)](./harp-map-controls.getwidthandheightfromcanvas.md) | Extracts the CSS width and height of the given canvas if available, or width and height of the canvas otherwise. |
|  [safeParseDecimalInt(text, fallback)](./harp-map-controls.safeparsedecimalint.md) | Safely parses decimal value into <code>number</code>.<!-- -->Safely falls back to default value for <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, <code>NaN</code>, empty strings, and strings with characters other than digits. |
