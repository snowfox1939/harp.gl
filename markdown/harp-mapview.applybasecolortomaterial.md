## applyBaseColorToMaterial() function

Apply technique base color (transparency support) to material with modifying material opacity.

This method applies main (or base) technique color with transparency support to the corresponding material color, with an effect on entire \[\[THREE.Material\]\] \_\_opacity\_\_ and \_\_transparent\_\_ attributes.

 Transparent colors should be processed as the very last technique attributes, since their effect on material properties like \[\[THREE.Material.opacity\]\] and \[\[THREE.Material.transparent\]\] could be overridden by corresponding technique params.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function applyBaseColorToMaterial(material: THREE.Material, materialColor: THREE.Color, technique: Technique, techniqueColor: Value, env?: Env): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  material | THREE.Material | the material to which color is applied |
|  materialColor | THREE.Color |  |
|  technique | [Technique](./harp-datasource-protocol.technique.md) | an technique the applied color comes from |
|  techniqueColor | [Value](./harp-datasource-protocol.value.md) |  |
|  env | [Env](./harp-datasource-protocol.env.md) | \[\[Env\]\] instance used to evaluate \[\[Expr\]\] based properties of \[\[Technique\]\] |

<b>Returns:</b>
