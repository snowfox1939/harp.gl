## MapView.intersectMapObjects() method

Do a raycast on all objects in the scene. Useful for picking. Limited to objects that THREE.js can raycast, the solid lines that get their geometry in the shader cannot be tested for intersection.

Note, if a \[\[DataSource\]\] adds an \[\[Object3D\]\] to a \[\[Tile\]\], it will be only pickable once \[\[MapView.render\]\] has been called, this is because \[\[MapView.render\]\] method creates the internal three.js root \[\[Object3D\]\] which is used in the \[\[PickHandler\]\] internally. This method will not test for intersection custom objects added to the scene by for example calling directly the \[\[scene.add\]\] method from THREE.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
intersectMapObjects(x: number, y: number): PickResult[];
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  x | number | The X position in css/client coordinates (without applied display ratio). |
|  y | number | The Y position in css/client coordinates (without applied display ratio). |

<b>Returns:</b>

[PickResult](./harp-mapview.pickresult.md)<!-- -->\[\]

The list of intersection results.
