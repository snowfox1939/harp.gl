Returns timestamp in milliseconds since page load.

If the \[\[DOMHighResTimeStamp\]\] is supported, the resolution is up to 5 microseconds, otherwise it is in milliseconds. Timespans are computed by taking the difference between two samples.

Example:

```typescript
const now = PerformanceTimer.now();
// call some expensive function for which you want to check the duration.
const end = PerformanceTimer.now();
const elapsedTime = end - now;

```

static now(): number;
```
