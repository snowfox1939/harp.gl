## ClipPlanesEvaluator.evaluateClipPlanes() method

Compute near and far clipping planes distance.

Evaluation method should be called on every frame and camera clip planes updated. This is related to evaluator implementation and its input data, that may suddenly change such as camera position or angle, projection type or so. Some evaluators may not depend on all or even any of input objects, but to preserve compatibility with any evaluator type it is strongly recommended to update on every frame.  The camera clipping planes (near/far properties) aren't automatically updated via \#evaluateClipPlanes() call, user should do it manually if needed.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
evaluateClipPlanes(camera: THREE.Camera, projection: Projection, elevationProvider?: ElevationProvider): ViewRanges;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  camera | THREE.Camera | The \[\[THREE.Camera\]\] in use. |
|  projection | [Projection](./harp-geoutils.projection.md) | The geo-projection currently used for encoding geographic data. |
|  elevationProvider | [ElevationProvider](./harp-mapview.elevationprovider.md) | The optional elevation provider for fine tuned range calculation, taking into account terrain variability and unevenness. |

<b>Returns:</b>

ViewRanges
