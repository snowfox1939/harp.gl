## MapViewOptions.dynamicPixelRatio property

Set fixed pixel ratio for rendering when the camera is moving or an animation is running. Useful when rendering on high resolution displays with low performance GPUs that may be fill-rate limited.

If a value is specified, a low resolution render pass is used to render the scene into a low resolution render target, before it is copied to the screen.

A value of `undefined` disables the low res render pass. Values between 0.5 and `window.devicePixelRatio` can be tried to give good results. The value should not be larger than `window.devicePixelRatio`<!-- -->.

 Since no anti-aliasing is applied during dynamic rendering with `dynamicPixelRatio` defined, visual artifacts may occur, especially with thin lines..

 The resolution of icons and text labels is not affected.

 `undefined`
