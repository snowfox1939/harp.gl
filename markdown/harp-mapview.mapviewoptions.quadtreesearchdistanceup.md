## MapViewOptions.quadTreeSearchDistanceUp property

Limits the number of reduced zoom levels (lower detail) to be searched for fallback tiles.

When zooming in, newly elected tiles may have not yet loaded. \[\[MapView\]\] searches through the tile cache for tiles ready to be displayed in lower zoom levels. The tiles may be located shallower in the quadtree.

To disable a cache search, set the value to `0`<!-- -->.
