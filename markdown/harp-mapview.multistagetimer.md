## MultiStageTimer class

Measures a sequence of connected events, such as multiple processing stages in a function. Each stage is identified with a timer name, that must be a valid timer in the statistics object. Additionally, all timers within a `MultiStageTimer` must be unique.

Internally, the `MultiStageTimer` manages a list of timers where at the end of each stage, one timer stops and the next timer starts.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class MultiStageTimer 
```
