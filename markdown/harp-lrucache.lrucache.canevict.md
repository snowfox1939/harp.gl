## LRUCache.canEvict property

Optional callback that is called on every item that should be evicted from the cache to determine if it can be removed, or should be locked in the cache.

It returns `true` if the item can be removed from cache, `false` otherwise. Locking items in the cache should be a temporary measure, since if the cache is filled with non-evictable items only, it may grow beyond its capacity.

\*\*Note\*\*: This callback is not called when an item is explicitly deleted from the map via \[\[delete\]\] or \[\[clear\]\].

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
canEvict?: (key: Key, value: Value) => boolean;
```
