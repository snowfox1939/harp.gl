## CameraMovementDetector class

The `CameraMovementDetector` class checks for changes in camera position and orientation, to detect continuous movements without the animation mode activated in \[\[MapView\]\]. If the interaction is not continuous enough, you can use a throttling timer to reduce the number of callbacks.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class CameraMovementDetector 
```

## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)(m\_throttlingTimeout, m\_movementStartedFunc, m\_movementFinishedFunc)](./harp-mapview.cameramovementdetector._constructor_.md) |  | Initializes the detector with timeout value and callbacks. \[\[MapView\]\] also provides events for client code to be notified when these cues occur. |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [cameraIsMoving](./harp-mapview.cameramovementdetector.cameraismoving.md) |  | boolean | Returns <code>true</code> if the camera of this \[\[MapView\]\] is currently moving. In this case the <code>m_movementFinishedFunc</code> is waiting to be called after the throttling timer runs out. |
|  [cameraMovedLastFrame](./harp-mapview.cameramovementdetector.cameramovedlastframe.md) |  | boolean | Returns <code>true</code> if the camera has moved in the last frame. |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [checkCameraMoved(mapView, now)](./harp-mapview.cameramovementdetector.checkcameramoved.md) |  | Checks if the camera has moved since the last time it was checked. The <code>m_movementStartedFunc</code> is called when a movement starts. If no movement is detected, a timer for <code>m_movementFinishedFunc</code> starts. |
|  [clear(mapView)](./harp-mapview.cameramovementdetector.clear.md) |  | Reset the saved camera position. Next time checkCameraMoved is called, it will return <code>false</code>. |
|  [dispose()](./harp-mapview.cameramovementdetector.dispose.md) |  | Disposes resources and kills the throttling timer. |
|  [forceMoved()](./harp-mapview.cameramovementdetector.forcemoved.md) |  | Force change of camera position. Next time checkCameraMoved is called, it will return <code>true</code>. |
