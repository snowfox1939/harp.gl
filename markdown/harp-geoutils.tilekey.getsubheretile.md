## TileKey.getSubHereTile() method

Returns a sub quadkey that is relative to its parent.

This function can be used to generate sub keys that are relative to a parent that is delta levels up in the quadtree.

This function can be used to create shortened keys for quads on lower levels if the parent is known.

Note - the sub quadkeys fit in a 16-bit unsigned integer if the `delta` is smaller than 8. If `delta` is smaller than 16, the sub quadkey fits into an unsigned 32-bit integer.

Deltas larger than 16 are not supported.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
getSubHereTile(delta: number): string;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  delta | number | The number of levels relative to its parent quadkey. Must be greater or equal to 0 and smaller than 16. |

<b>Returns:</b>

string

The quadkey relative to its parent that is `delta` levels up the tree.
