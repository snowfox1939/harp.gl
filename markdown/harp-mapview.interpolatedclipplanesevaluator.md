## InterpolatedClipPlanesEvaluator class

> Warning: This API is now obsolete.

> Class contains the legacy (first and original) clip planes evaluation method, which is widely used in examples thus is still kept for backward compatibility and comparisons.

Simplest camera clip planes evaluator, interpolates near/far planes based on ground distance.

At general ground distance to camera along the surface normal is used as reference point for planes evaluation, where near plane distance is set as fraction of this distance refereed as \[\[nearMultiplier\]\]. Far plane equation has its own multiplier - \[\[nearFarMultiplier\]\], which is applied to near plane and offset giving finally far plane distance. This evaluator supports both planar and spherical projections, although it's behavior is slightly different in each case. General algorithm sets near plane between camera and ground level, while far plane is just calculated using scale and bias approach with far offset and multiplier.
