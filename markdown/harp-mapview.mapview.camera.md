## MapView.camera property

The THREE.js camera used by this `MapView` to render the main scene.  When modifying the camera all derived properties like: - \[\[MapView.target\]\] - \[\[MapView.zoomLevel\]\] - \[\[MapView.tilt\]\] - \[\[MapView.heading\]\] could change. These properties are cached internaly and will only be updated in the next animation frame. FIXME: Unfortunatley THREE.js is not dispatching any events when camera properties change so we should have an API for enforcing update of cached values.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
get camera(): THREE.PerspectiveCamera;
```
