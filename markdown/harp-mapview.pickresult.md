## PickResult interface

A general pick result. You can access the details of a picked geometry from the property `intersection`<!-- -->, which is available if a geometry was hit. If a road was hit, a \[\[RoadPickResult\]\] is returned, which has additional information, but no `intersection`<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface PickResult 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |

|  [featureId](./harp-mapview.pickresult.featureid.md) | number | An optional feature ID of the picked object; typically applies to the Optimized Map Vector (OMV) format. |
|  [intersection](./harp-mapview.pickresult.intersection.md) | THREE.Intersection | Defined for geometry only. |
|  [point](./harp-mapview.pickresult.point.md) | THREE.Vector2 \| THREE.Vector3 | A 2D point in screen coordinates, or a 3D point in world coordinates. |
|  [technique](./harp-mapview.pickresult.technique.md) | [Technique](./harp-datasource-protocol.technique.md) | Defined for roads or if <code>enableTechniqueInfo</code> option is enabled. |
|  [type](./harp-mapview.pickresult.type.md) | [PickObjectType](./harp-mapview.pickobjecttype.md) | General type of object. |
|  [userData](./harp-mapview.pickresult.userdata.md) | any | Optional user data that has been defined in the picked object. This object points directly to information contained in the original \[\[TileFeatureData\]\] stored in \[\[MapView\]\], and should not be modified. |
