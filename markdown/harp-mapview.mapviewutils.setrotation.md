## MapViewUtils.setRotation() function

Sets the rotation of the camera according to yaw and pitch in degrees. The computations hinge on the current projection and `geoCenter`<!-- -->, because yaw and pitch are defined in tangent space. In particular, `MapView#geoCenter` needs to be set before calling `setRotation`<!-- -->.

\*\*Note:\*\* `yaw == 0 && pitch == 0` will north up the map and you will look downwards onto the map.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
function setRotation(mapView: MapView, yawDeg: number, pitchDeg: number): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  mapView | [MapView](./harp-mapview.mapview.md) | Instance of MapView. |
|  yawDeg | number | Yaw in degrees, counter-clockwise (as opposed to azimuth), starting north. |
|  pitchDeg | number | Pitch in degrees. |

<b>Returns:</b>

void
