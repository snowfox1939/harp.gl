## OmvFeatureModifier interface

The `OmvFeatureModifier` can be used to filter individual features. It gets passed in the \[\[Env\]\] of the feature, which contains all the values that can be searched for in a style. If a filter function returns false, the feature is ignored, and no geometry is being created.

In addition to pure filtering, the `OmvFeatureModifier` can also modify the \[\[Env\]\] of the feature, or even add new properties to the feature, for example, traffic states. The `OmvFeatureModifier` is executed before the styles are selected, so the geometry is created with the modified feature properties.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface OmvFeatureModifier 
```
