## MapViewOptions.quadTreeSearchDistanceDown property

Limits the number of higher zoom levels (more detailed) to be searched for fallback tiles.

When zooming out, newly elected tiles may have not yet loaded. \[\[MapView\]\] searches through the tile cache for tiles ready to be displayed in higher zoom levels. These tiles may be located deeper in the quadtree.

To disable a cache search, set the value to `0`<!-- -->.
