## resolveReferenceUri() function

Resolve URI of referenced object w.r.t parent URI.

Resolves `childUri` as it would be loaded from location specified by `parentUri`<!-- -->.

If `childUri` is absolute, then it is returned unchanged. If `childUri` is origin-absolute path, then only origin path is taken from `parentUri`<!-- -->.

See \[\[baseUri\]\] for reference how base URL of `parentUri` is determined.

Supports `http:`<!-- -->, `https:`<!-- -->, `file:`<!-- -->, `data:` schemes.

Examples:

// normal case, child is sibling https://foo.com/themes/day.json + images/foo.png -<!-- -->&gt; https://foo.com/themes/images/foo.png

// parent is "folder", so child is just located in this folder https://foo.com/themes/ + images/foo.png -<!-- -->&gt; https://foo.com/themes/images/foo.png

// parent looks like leaf, so last component is stripped https://foo.com/themes + images/foo.png -<!-- -->&gt; https://foo.com/images/foo.png

// origin-absolute URL, takes only origin from parent https://foo.com/themes/day.json + /fonts/foo.json -<!-- -->&gt; https://foo.com/fonts/foo.json
