## MapViewOptions.politicalView property

Sets the data sources to use specific country point of view (political view).

This option may result in rendering different country borders then commonly accepted for some regions and it mainly regards to so called \_\_disputed borders\_\_. Although not all data sources or themes may support it.

 Country code should be coded in lower-case ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard, if this option is `undefined` the majority point of view will be used.
