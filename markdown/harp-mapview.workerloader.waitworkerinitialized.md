## WorkerLoader.waitWorkerInitialized() method

Waits for successful Web Worker start.

Expects that worker script sends initial message.

If first event is `message` then assumes that worker has been loaded sussesfully and promise resolves to `worker` object passed as argument.

If first event is 'error', then it is assumed that worker failed to load and promise is rejected.

(NOTE: The initial 'message' - if received - is immediately replayed using worker's `dispatchEvent`<!-- -->, so application code can also consume it as confirmation of successful worker initialization.

We must resolve/reject promise at some time, so it is expected that any sane application will be able to load worker code in some amount of time.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
static waitWorkerInitialized(worker: Worker, timeout: number): Promise<Worker>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  worker | Worker | \[\[Worker\]\] instance to be checked |
|  timeout | number | timeout in milliseconds, in which worker should set initial message |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;Worker&gt;

`Promise` that resolves to `worker` on success
