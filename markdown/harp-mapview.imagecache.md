## ImageCache class

`ImageCache` is a singleton, so it can be used with multiple MapViews on a single page. This allows to have an image loaded only once for multiple views. THREE is doing something similar, but does not allow to share images that have been loaded from a canvas (which we may need to do if we use SVG images for textures).

One application that makes our own cache necessary is the generation of our own textures from data that is not an URL.

The `ImageCache` can be improved by adding satistics for memory footprint as well.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class ImageCache 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [instance](./harp-mapview.imagecache.instance.md) | <code>static</code> | [ImageCache](./harp-mapview.imagecache.md) | Returns the singleton <code>instance</code> of the <code>ImageCache</code>. |
|  [size](./harp-mapview.imagecache.size.md) |  | number | Returns the number of all cached \[\[ImageItem\]\]s. |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [addImage(mapView, url, startLoading)](./harp-mapview.imagecache.addimage.md) |  | Add an image definition, and optionally start loading the content. |
|  [clear(mapView)](./harp-mapview.imagecache.clear.md) |  | Clear all \[\[ImageItem\]\]s belonging to a \[\[MapView\]\]. May remove cached items if no \[\[MapView\]\] are registered anymore. |
|  [clearAll()](./harp-mapview.imagecache.clearall.md) |  | Clear all \[\[ImageItem\]\]s from all \[\[MapView\]\]s. |
|  [dispose()](./harp-mapview.imagecache.dispose.md) | <code>static</code> | Dispose the singleton object. Not normally implemented for singletons, but good for debugging. |
|  [findImage(url)](./harp-mapview.imagecache.findimage.md) |  | Find \[\[ImageItem\]\] for the specified URL. |
|  [loadImage(imageItem)](./harp-mapview.imagecache.loadimage.md) |  | Load an \[\[ImageItem\]\]. If the loading process is already running, it returns the current promise. |
|  [registerImage(mapView, url, imageData)](./harp-mapview.imagecache.registerimage.md) |  | Add an image definition to the global cache. Useful when the image data is already loaded. |
