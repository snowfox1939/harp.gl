## MapControls.doubleTapTime property

Double click uses the OS delay through the double click event. Tapping is implemented locally here in `MapControls` with this duration setting the maximum delay to define a double tap. The value is in seconds. `300ms` is picked as the default value as jQuery does.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
doubleTapTime: number;
```
