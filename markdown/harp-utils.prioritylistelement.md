## PriorityListElement interface

A `PriorityListElement` has a priority to assist in sorting. The idea is that the items in a grouped priority list will not modify their priority during processing to such an amount, that they will change into another group. Smaller lists are smaller to sort, and in case of resource limitation (maximum number of rendered objects reached), not all items have to be sorted at all.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface PriorityListElement 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
