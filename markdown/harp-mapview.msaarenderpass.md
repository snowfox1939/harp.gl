## MSAARenderPass class

\[\[MapView\]\]'s MSAA implementation. MSAA stands for Multi Sampling Anti-Aliasing, and its concept is to provide a rendering engine with additional color values for each pixel, so they can include the missing bits between them on a screen. WebGL already comes with a native MSAA implementation with four samples. Because of its native nature, it is more efficient and one may not want to use MapView's MSAA implementation when these four samples are satisfying. However in some situations they are not: on low devices, MSAA can impact the framerate and we may desire to reduce the number of samples at runtime. On the other hand, when the interaction stops, the engine also stops rendering the map, and because a map relies on many line-like patterns, aliasing can then turn very noticeable. In such static renders, the number of samples could be dramatically increased on a last frame to render.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class MSAARenderPass extends Pass 
```

## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)()](./harp-mapview.msaarenderpass._constructor_.md) |  | The constructor for <code>MSAARenderPass</code>. It builds an internal scene with a camera looking at a quad. |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [OffsetVectors](./harp-mapview.msaarenderpass.offsetvectors.md) | <code>static</code> | number\[\]\[\]\[\] | The list of offsets to apply to the camera, per sampling level, adapted from : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff476218%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396 |
|  [samplingLevel](./harp-mapview.msaarenderpass.samplinglevel.md) |  | [MSAASampling](./harp-mapview.msaasampling.md) | The sampling level determines the number of samples that will be performed per frame. Renders will happen <code>2 ^ samplingLevel</code> time(s). <code>samplingLevel</code> stands between <code>0</code> and <code>5</code>. Therefore there can be between 1 and 32 samples. <code>SamplingLevel.Level_1</code> |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [dispose()](./harp-mapview.msaarenderpass.dispose.md) |  | Releases all used resources. |
|  [render(renderer, scene, camera, writeBuffer, readBuffer)](./harp-mapview.msaarenderpass.render.md) |  | The render function of <code>MSAARenderPass</code>. At each call of this method, and for each sample, the \[\[MapView\]\] camera provided in the <code>render</code> method is offset within the dimension of a pixel on screen. It then renders the whole scene with this offset to a local <code>WebGLRenderTarget</code> instance, via a <code>WebGLRenderer</code> instance. Finally the local camera created in the constructor shoots the quad and renders to the write buffer or to the frame buffer. The quad material's opacity is modified so the renders can accumulate in the targetted buffer.<!-- -->The number of samples can be modified at runtime through the enum \[\[SamplingLevel\]\].<!-- -->If there is no further pass, the \[\[Pass.renderToScreen\]\] flag can be set to <code>true</code> to output directly to the framebuffer. |
|  [setSize(width, height)](./harp-mapview.msaarenderpass.setsize.md) |  | Resize the internal render target to match the new size specified. |
