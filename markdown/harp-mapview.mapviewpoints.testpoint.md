## MapViewPoints.testPoint() method

Implements the intersection testing in screen space between the drawn points and the ray. The drawing of the points being different between \[\[Circles\]\] and \[\[Squares\]\], this method is implemented in these child classes.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
abstract testPoint(point: THREE.Vector3, screenPosition: THREE.Vector2, pickCoordinates: THREE.Vector2, index: number, distance: number, intersects: THREE.Intersection[]): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  point | THREE.Vector3 | The point to test. |
|  screenPosition | THREE.Vector2 | The point position on screen. |
|  pickCoordinates | THREE.Vector2 | The picking position on screen. |
|  index | number | The index of the point in the \[\[THREE.Geometry\]\]. |
|  distance | number | The distance between the point and the ray origin. |
|  intersects | THREE.Intersection\[\] | The results array. |

<b>Returns:</b>

void
