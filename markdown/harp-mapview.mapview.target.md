## MapView.target property

Get geo coordinates of camera focus (target) point. This point is not necessarily on the ground, i.e.: - if the tilt is high and projection is \[\[sphereProjection\]\] - if the camera was modified directly and is not pointing to the ground. In any case the projection of the target point will be in the center of the screen.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
get target(): GeoCoordinates;
```
