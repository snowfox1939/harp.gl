## MapControls.zoomLevelDeltaOnMouseWheel property

Determines the zoom level delta for single mouse wheel movement. So after each mouse wheel movement the current zoom level will be added or subtracted by this value. The default value is `0.2` - this means that every 5th mouse wheel movement you will cross a zoom level.

\*\*Note\*\*: To reverse the zoom direction, you can provide a negative value.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
zoomLevelDeltaOnMouseWheel: number;
```
