## Pass class

The base class to extend for further passes in \[\[MapView\]\], like the \[\[MSAARenderPass\]\], possibly a text pass, an AO effect etc. `Pass` provides the core logic for both : - render passes (proper scene renders), - and shader passes (quad renders, i.e. effects added on top of the render output as a postprocess).

Even some shader passes still actually fall within the render pass category as they need to re-render the scene to then deduce an effect, such as masking, AO, DoF etc. Others just need the previous input image to apply a shader on top of it, as for bloom or NVIDIA's FXAA for example. These only are proper shader passes.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class Pass implements IPass 
```
