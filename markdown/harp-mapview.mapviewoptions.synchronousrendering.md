## MapViewOptions.synchronousRendering property

Set to `true` to allow rendering scene synchronously.

By calling `renderSync()` scene draws immediately, opposite to default case when `update` method requests redraw and waits for the next animation frame.

You need to set up your own render loop controller. Event `MapViewEventNames.Update` fired when \[\[MapView\]\] requests for an redraw. E.g.: When tiles loaded asynchronously and ready for rendering.

 Internal `maxFps` will be overridden and may not work properly as `renderSync` intended to be called from external render loop.

 false.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
synchronousRendering?: boolean;
```
