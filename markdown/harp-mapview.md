|  [AnimatedExtrusionTileHandler](./harp-mapview.animatedextrusiontilehandler.md) | Implements animated extrusion effect for the extruded objects in the \[\[Tile\]\] |
|  [BufferedGeometryAccessor](./harp-mapview.bufferedgeometryaccessor.md) | Abstract base class of an accessor for nonindexed geometry. |
|  [BufferedGeometryAccessorBase](./harp-mapview.bufferedgeometryaccessorbase.md) | Geometry accessor for both indexed and nonindexed <code>BufferedGeometry</code>. |
|  [BufferedGeometryLineAccessor](./harp-mapview.bufferedgeometrylineaccessor.md) | Accessor for nonindexed line geometry. |
|  [BufferedGeometryObject3dAccessor](./harp-mapview.bufferedgeometryobject3daccessor.md) | Accessor for nonindexed unspecified (<code>Object3D</code>) geometry. |
|  [CameraMovementDetector](./harp-mapview.cameramovementdetector.md) | The <code>CameraMovementDetector</code> class checks for changes in camera position and orientation, to detect continuous movements without the animation mode activated in \[\[MapView\]\]. If the interaction is not continuous enough, you can use a throttling timer to reduce the number of callbacks. |
|  [Circles](./harp-mapview.circles.md) | Point object that implements the raycasting of circles in screen space. |
|  [ColorCache](./harp-mapview.colorcache.md) | Use <code>ColorCache</code> to reuse a color specified by name and save allocation as well as setup time.<!-- -->Implemented as a singleton. Do not modify colors after getting them from the <code>ColorCache</code>. |
|  [ConcurrentDecoderFacade](./harp-mapview.concurrentdecoderfacade.md) | Default concurrent decoder helper.<!-- -->A convenient singleton that maintains a separate \[\[ConcurrentWorkerSet\]\] for each bundle requested. Provides easy access to \[\[WorkerBasedDecoder\]\]s for data sources. |
|  [ConcurrentTilerFacade](./harp-mapview.concurrenttilerfacade.md) | Default concurrent tiler helper.<!-- -->A convenient singleton that maintains a separate \[\[ConcurrentWorkerSet\]\] for each bundle requested. Provides easy access to \[\[WorkerBasedTiler\]\]s for data sources. |
|  [CopyrightCoverageProvider](./harp-mapview.copyrightcoverageprovider.md) | Base class to provide copyrights based on copyright coverage information, defined by geographical bounding boxes and relevant zoom level ranges. |
|  [CopyrightElementHandler](./harp-mapview.copyrightelementhandler.md) | Helper class that maintains up-to-date \[\[MapView\]\] copyright information in DOM element. |
|  [DataSource](./harp-mapview.datasource.md) | Derive a class from <code>DataSource</code> to contribute data and geometries to the \[\[MapView\]\]. |
|  [ElevationBasedClipPlanesEvaluator](./harp-mapview.elevationbasedclipplanesevaluator.md) | Abstract evaluator class that adds support for elevation constraints.<!-- -->Classes derived from this should implement algorithms that takes into account rendered features height (elevations), such as ground plane is no more flat (or spherical), but contains geometry that should be overlapped by frustum planes. |
|  [FixedClipPlanesEvaluator](./harp-mapview.fixedclipplanesevaluator.md) | Provides the most basic evaluation concept giving fixed values with some constraints. |
|  [FrameStats](./harp-mapview.framestats.md) | Class containing all counters, timers and events of the current frame. |
|  [FrameStatsArray](./harp-mapview.framestatsarray.md) |  Only exported for testing.<!-- -->Instead of passing around an array of objects, we store the frame statistics as an object of arrays. This allows convenient computations from \[\[RingBuffer\]\], |
|  [ImageCache](./harp-mapview.imagecache.md) | <code>ImageCache</code> is a singleton, so it can be used with multiple MapViews on a single page. This allows to have an image loaded only once for multiple views. THREE is doing something similar, but does not allow to share images that have been loaded from a canvas (which we may need to do if we use SVG images for textures).<!-- -->One application that makes our own cache necessary is the generation of our own textures from data that is not an URL.<!-- -->The <code>ImageCache</code> can be improved by adding satistics for memory footprint as well. |
|  [IndexedBufferedGeometryAccessor](./harp-mapview.indexedbufferedgeometryaccessor.md) | Abstract base class of indexed geometry. |
|  [IndexedBufferedGeometryLineAccessor](./harp-mapview.indexedbufferedgeometrylineaccessor.md) | Accessor for lines in an indexed geometry. |
|  [InterpolatedClipPlanesEvaluator](./harp-mapview.interpolatedclipplanesevaluator.md) | Simplest camera clip planes evaluator, interpolates near/far planes based on ground distance.<!-- -->At general ground distance to camera along the surface normal is used as reference point for planes evaluation, where near plane distance is set as fraction of this distance refereed as \[\[nearMultiplier\]\]. Far plane equation has its own multiplier - \[\[nearFarMultiplier\]\], which is applied to near plane and offset giving finally far plane distance. This evaluator supports both planar and spherical projections, although it's behavior is slightly different in each case. General algorithm sets near plane between camera and ground level, while far plane is just calculated using scale and bias approach with far offset and multiplier. |
|  [MapRenderingManager](./harp-mapview.maprenderingmanager.md) | The implementation of \[\[IMapRenderingManager\]\] to instantiate in \[\[MapView\]\] and manage the map rendering. |
|  [MapView](./harp-mapview.mapview.md) | The core class of the library to call in order to create a map visualization. It needs to be linked to datasources. |
|  [MapViewAtmosphere](./harp-mapview.mapviewatmosphere.md) | Class that provides \[\[MapView\]\]'s atmospheric scattering effect. |
|  [MapViewFog](./harp-mapview.mapviewfog.md) | Manages the fog display in \[\[MapView\]\]. |
|  [MapViewImageCache](./harp-mapview.mapviewimagecache.md) | Cache images wrapped into \[\[ImageItem\]\]s for a \[\[MapView\]\]. An image may have multiple names in a theme, the <code>MapViewImageCache</code> will take care of that. Registering multiple images with the same name is invalid.<!-- -->The <code>MapViewImageCache</code> uses a global \[\[ImageCache\]\] to actually store (and generate) the image data. |
|  [MapViewPoints](./harp-mapview.mapviewpoints.md) | <code>MapViewPoints</code> is a class to extend for the <code>&quot;circles&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;squares&quot;</code> \[\[Technique\]\]s to implement raycasting of \[\[THREE.Points\]\] as expected in \[\[MapView\]\], that are in screen space. It copies the behaviour of the <code>raycast</code> method in \[\[THREE.Points\]\] and dispatches it to its children classes, \[\[Circles\]\] and \[\[Squares\]\], who hold the intersection testing in the <code>testPoint</code> method. This class also has the ability to dismiss the testing via the <code>enableRayTesting</code> flag.<!-- -->Its main motivation is to handle the point styles of XYZ projects. https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/src/objects/Points.js |
|  [MSAARenderPass](./harp-mapview.msaarenderpass.md) | \[\[MapView\]\]'s MSAA implementation. MSAA stands for Multi Sampling Anti-Aliasing, and its concept is to provide a rendering engine with additional color values for each pixel, so they can include the missing bits between them on a screen. WebGL already comes with a native MSAA implementation with four samples. Because of its native nature, it is more efficient and one may not want to use MapView's MSAA implementation when these four samples are satisfying. However in some situations they are not: on low devices, MSAA can impact the framerate and we may desire to reduce the number of samples at runtime. On the other hand, when the interaction stops, the engine also stops rendering the map, and because a map relies on many line-like patterns, aliasing can then turn very noticeable. In such static renders, the number of samples could be dramatically increased on a last frame to render. |
|  [MultiStageTimer](./harp-mapview.multistagetimer.md) | Measures a sequence of connected events, such as multiple processing stages in a function. Each stage is identified with a timer name, that must be a valid timer in the statistics object. Additionally, all timers within a <code>MultiStageTimer</code> must be unique.<!-- -->Internally, the <code>MultiStageTimer</code> manages a list of timers where at the end of each stage, one timer stops and the next timer starts. |
|  [Pass](./harp-mapview.pass.md) | The base class to extend for further passes in \[\[MapView\]\], like the \[\[MSAARenderPass\]\], possibly a text pass, an AO effect etc. <code>Pass</code> provides the core logic for both : - render passes (proper scene renders), - and shader passes (quad renders, i.e. effects added on top of the render output as a postprocess).<!-- -->Even some shader passes still actually fall within the render pass category as they need to re-render the scene to then deduce an effect, such as masking, AO, DoF etc. Others just need the previous input image to apply a shader on top of it, as for bloom or NVIDIA's FXAA for example. These only are proper shader passes. |
|  [PerformanceStatistics](./harp-mapview.performancestatistics.md) | Performance measurement central. Maintains the current \[\[FrameStats\]\], which holds all individual performance numbers.<!-- -->Implemented as an instance for easy access. |
|  [PoiManager](./harp-mapview.poimanager.md) | POI manager class, responsible for loading the \[\[PoiGeometry\]\] objects from the \[\[DecodedTile\]\], and preparing them for rendering. Also loads and manages the texture atlases for the icons. |
|  [PoiTable](./harp-mapview.poitable.md) | The <code>PoiTable</code> stores individual information for each POI type. If a \[\[TextElement\]\] has a reference to a PoiTable (if TextElement.poiInfo.poiTableName is set), information for the TextElement and its icon are read from the PoiTable.<!-- -->The key to look up the POI is taken from the data, in case of OSM data with TileZen data, the <code>poiNameField</code> is set to <code>kind</code>, which makes the content of the field <code>kind</code> in the data the key to look up the POIs in the \[\[PoiTable\]\].<!-- -->On the side of the \[\[PoiTable\]\], the key to look up the PoiTableEntry is either the property "name" of the \[\[PoiTableEntry\]\] (which should be unique), or the alternative list of names <code>altNames</code>, where each value should also be unique. If the property <code>useAltNamesForKey</code> is set to <code>true</code>, the <code>altNames</code> will be used. |
|  [PoiTableManager](./harp-mapview.poitablemanager.md) | The <code>PoiTableManager</code> manages the list of \[\[PoiTables\]\] that can be defined in the \[\[Theme\]\] file. |
|  [PolarTileDataSource](./harp-mapview.polartiledatasource.md) | \[\[DataSource\]\] providing geometry for poles |
|  [RingBuffer](./harp-mapview.ringbuffer.md) | A simple ring buffer to store the last <code>n</code> values of the timer. The buffer works on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis. |
|  [SampledTimer](./harp-mapview.sampledtimer.md) | A timer that stores the last <code>n</code> samples in a ring buffer. |
|  [SimpleTimer](./harp-mapview.simpletimer.md) | A simple timer that stores only the latest measurement. |
|  [Squares](./harp-mapview.squares.md) | Point object that implements the raycasting of squares in screen space. |
|  [Statistics](./harp-mapview.statistics.md) | Manages a set of timers. The main objective of <code>Statistics</code> is to log these timers. You can disable statistics to minimize their impact on performance. |
|  [TextElement](./harp-mapview.textelement.md) | <code>TextElement</code> is used to create 2D text elements (for example, labels). |
|  [TextElementsRenderer](./harp-mapview.textelementsrenderer.md) | Internal class to manage all text rendering. |
|  [TextStyleCache](./harp-mapview.textstylecache.md) |  |
|  [TextureLoader](./harp-mapview.textureloader.md) | A texture loader that supports request headers(e.g. for Authorization) |
|  [ThemeLoader](./harp-mapview.themeloader.md) | Loads and validates a theme from URL objects. |
|  [Tile](./harp-mapview.tile.md) | The class that holds the tiled data for a \[\[DataSource\]\]. |
|  [TileDataAccessor](./harp-mapview.tiledataaccessor.md) | An accessor for all geometries in a tile. This class uses a client-provided \[\[ITileDataVisitor\]\] to visit all objects, based on filtering options specified by both, the <code>TileDataAccessor</code> and the visitor itself. |
|  [TiltViewClipPlanesEvaluator](./harp-mapview.tiltviewclipplanesevaluator.md) | Evaluates camera clipping planes taking into account ground distance and camera angles.<!-- -->This evaluator provides support for camera with varying tilt (pitch) angle, the angle between camera \_\_look at\_\_ vector and the ground surface normal. |
|  [TopViewClipPlanesEvaluator](./harp-mapview.topviewclipplanesevaluator.md) | Top view, clip planes evaluator that computes view ranges based on ground distance and elevation.<!-- -->This evaluator supports both planar and spherical projections, although it behavior is slightly different in each case. General algorithm sets near plane and far plane close to ground level, but taking into account maximum and minimum elevation of features on the ground. This evaluator supports only cameras which are always looking down the ground surface (top-down view) along surface normal and does not preserve correct clip planes when modifying camera pitch (tilt) angle. In simple words it is suitable only for top view camera settings. |
|  [UrlCopyrightProvider](./harp-mapview.urlcopyrightprovider.md) | Copyright provider which retrieves copyright coverage information from provided URL. |
|  [VisibleTileSet](./harp-mapview.visibletileset.md) | Manages visible \[\[Tile\]\]s for \[\[MapView\]\].<!-- -->Responsible for election of rendered tiles: - quad-tree traversal - frustum culling - sorting tiles by relevance (visible area) to prioritize load - limiting number of visible tiles - caching tiles - searching cache to replace visible but yet empty tiles with already loaded siblings in nearby zoom levels |
|  [WorkerBasedDecoder](./harp-mapview.workerbaseddecoder.md) | Decoder based on \[\[ConcurrentWorkerSet\]\].<!-- -->Decodes tiles using workers running in separate contexts (also known as <code>WebWorkers</code>): - connection establishment, - sends decode requests, - configuration. |
