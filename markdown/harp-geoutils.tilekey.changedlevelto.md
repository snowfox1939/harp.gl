## TileKey.changedLevelTo() method

Returns a new tile key at the requested level.

If the requested level is smaller than the tile's level, then the key of an ancestor of this tile is returned. If the requested level is larger than the tile's level, then the key of first child or grandchild of this tile is returned, for example, the child with the lowest row and column number. If the requested level equals this tile's level, then the tile key itself is returned. If the requested level is negative, the root tile key is returned.
