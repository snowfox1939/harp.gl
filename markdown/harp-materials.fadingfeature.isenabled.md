## FadingFeature.isEnabled() function

Checks if feature is enabled based on feature params.

Fading feature will be disabled if fadeFar is undefined or fadeFar &lt;<!-- -->= 0.0. This function is crucial for shader switching (chunks injection), whenever feature state changes between enabled/disabled. Current approach is to keep feature on (once enabled) whenever fading params are reasonable, even if it causes full fade in, no transparency.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
function isEnabled(fadingMaterial: FadingFeature): boolean;
```
