## MapViewUtils.calculateDepthFromClipDistance() function

Translates a linear clip-space distance value to the actual value stored in the depth buffer. This is useful as the depth values are not stored in the depth buffer linearly, and this can lead into confusing behavior when not taken into account.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
function calculateDepthFromClipDistance(clipDistance: number, camera: THREE.Camera): number;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  clipDistance | number | Distance from the camera in clip space (range: \[0, 1\]). |
|  camera | THREE.Camera | Camera applying the perspective projection. |

<b>Returns:</b>

number
