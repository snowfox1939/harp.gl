## MapViewPoints.raycast() method

This method is similar to the original method `raycast` in \[\[THREE.Points\]\] except that it then calls the tailored `testPoint` method in the children classes to test intersections depending on whether the points are circles or squares, which \[\[THREE.Points\]\] cannot do.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
raycast(raycaster: PickingRaycaster, intersects: THREE.Intersection[]): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  raycaster | PickingRaycaster | The raycaster. |
|  intersects | THREE.Intersection\[\] | The array to fill with the results. |

<b>Returns:</b>

void
