## DataSourceOptions.allowOverlappingTiles property

Whether the datasource can overlap tiles. Such overlapping is necessary when zooming out and waiting for the tiles to load, in this case, we use cached tiles to fill the missing gaps if available (and in some cases, the tiles can overlap, i.e. for example when a child is next to a parent, the parent is rendered beneath the child), however for some datasources (those that produce transparent tiles for example), this gives bad results, and as such, it should be disabled to reduce flickening. Another way to put it is that loading tiles are replaced with cached tiles and we then fall (back/forward) to the next appropriate zoom level.  true

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
allowOverlappingTiles?: boolean;
```
