## TransferManager class

`TransferManager` for downloading URLs.

Features:

\* Merges JSON downloads, for example, the same URL if requested as JSON will only be downloaded once. \* Limits the amount of parallel downloads, useful when requesting a large amount of URLs that would otherwise stall the browser. \* Retries the downloads with an increasing timeout on HTTP 503 replies.

The static method \[\[instance\]\] can be used to get a default constructed instance.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class TransferManager implements ITransferManager 
```
