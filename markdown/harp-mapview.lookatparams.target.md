## LookAtParams.target property

Target/look at point of the MapView.

 If the given point is not on the ground (altitude != 0) \[\[MapView\]\] will do a raycasting internally to find a target on the ground.

As a consequence \[\[MapView.target\]\] and \[\[MapView.zoomLevel\]\] will not match the values that were passed into the \[\[MapView.lookAt\]\] method.  `new GeoCoordinates(25, 0)` in \[\[MapView.constructor\]\] context.  \[\[MapView.target\]\] in \[\[MapView.lookAt\]\] context.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
target: GeoCoordLike;
```
